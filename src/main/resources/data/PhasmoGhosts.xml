            <Id>EMF-5</Id>
            <Name>EMF 5</Name>
            <Mechanics>When a ghost with EMF Level 5 as one of its evidences interacts with the
                environment, the EMF reading will have a 25% chance to be an EMF 5 emission instead
                of EMF 2 or EMF 3, which can be detected and confirmed with an EMF Reader.</Mechanics>
        </Evidence>
        <Evidence>
            <Id>Orb</Id>
            <Name>Ghost Orb</Name>
            <Mechanics>When a map is loaded in, Ghost Orbs will spawn in the favourite room and float
                within the room. They look like very small orbs that glide across the screen,
                generally one at a time. They can be seen through the screen on a Video Camera with
                night vision, or through any available video feed with night vision.

                Depending on the map and the location of the favourite room, Ghost Orbs can
                sometimes be seen via the map's CCTVs if the CCTV happens to be facing into the
                favourite room, though this is usually rare. Ghost Orbs will periodically shift
                position within the favourite room, forcing players to be more proactive in locating
                them.

                When the ghost room changes on difficulties where 'Changing favourite room' is not
                set to 'None' (such as on Professional and Nightmare), the Ghost Orbs will also move
                to the new favourite room.</Mechanics>

        <Evidence>
            <Id>SpiritBox</Id>
            <Name>Spirit Box</Name>
            <Mechanics>The Spirit Box is considered an electronic equipment. When interfered with, all the
                LEDs/icons will flicker rapidly. Holding an active Spirit Box within 7.5 metres of a
                ghost on the same floor will attract it to the player.

                Note that the ghost may still respond audibly if the player asks questions while the
                Spirit Box is being interfered with. This also counts as Spirit Box evidence.

                There is too many information about this device. Check wiki for mor info:

        <Evidence>
            <Id>Freezing</Id>
            <Name>Freezing</Name>
            <Mechanics>The presence of a ghost in a room will cause the room's temperature to decrease,
                regardless of evidence. Ghosts without Freezing Temperatures evidence will be able
                to drop the room's temperature to 1°C (33.8°F), whereas ghosts with Freezing
                Temperatures as evidence will be able to drop the temperature to −10°C (14°F).

                When the temperature drops to 5°C (41°F) or below, the players may be able to see
                their own breath; this does not necessarily mean that the ghost will have Freezing
                Temperatures as evidence. Freezing Temperatures can only be confirmed if the
                thermometer reads a temperature strictly below 1°C (33.8°F).

                If using a Tier I thermometer, Freezing Temperatures can only be confirmed if the
                thermometer reads a temperature strictly below 0°C (32°F) as it is less accurate.</Mechanics>

        <Evidence>
            <Id>Ultraviolet</Id>
            <Name>Ultraviolet</Name>
            <Mechanics>Ultraviolet evidence consists of fingerprints and footprints which can be revealed
                by using a UV Light.

                Each interaction on a valid surface will always produce a fingerprint or a footprint
                (except for the Obake which has a 25% chance to hide them).

                Additionally, the Obake can sometimes use an ability to reduce the remaining time
                for all existing fingerprints and footprints on the map by half.</Mechanics>

        <Evidence>
            <Id>Writing</Id>
            <Name>Writing</Name>
            <Mechanics>If Ghost Writing is a piece of evidence, if the ghost chooses to interact with an
                opened ghost writing book, the book will rise and frantic scribbling will be
                visible.

                There are six different types of Ghost Writing that a ghost can put in the book.
                Each has an equal chance of occurring and the type of writing does not narrow down
                the type of ghost any more than the fact that the ghost writes in the book at all.
                Each book may contain different types of writing.</Mechanics>

        <Evidence>
            <Id>DOTS</Id>
            <Name>D.O.T.S</Name>
            <Mechanics>The D.O.T.S Projector can be placed (default: F on keyboard) on a wall or floor
                similar to a motion sensor. It emits a matrix of bright green laser points in a
                small area from the projector. Tier I D.O.T.S Projector additionally can be held and
                toggled (default: right click on mouse) to create a cone of D.O.T.S light where it
                is pointed.

                Ghosts with D.O.T.S evidence will occasionally enter a 'D.O.T.S state'. During this,
                a faint silhouette of the ghost will be visible only when it passes through the
                laser grid. The ghost will also walk towards the nearest player if there is one in
                the same room, or towards a random waypoint if no players are nearby. While these
                silhouettes are visible to the naked eye (unless the ghost is a Goryo), a video
                camera with night vision may allow for better visibility. This also means that
                D.O.T.S can be tracked simultaneously alongside Ghost Orbs. Dead players cannot see
                D.O.T.S by any means.

                Though the D.O.T.S Projector is an electronic equipment, only the Tier I D.O.T.S.
                Projector when activated and held will attract the ghost to the player during a
                hunt, and they are otherwise safe to hold onto.</Mechanics>

                    <Name>Roaming to target</Name>
                    <Description>When the Banshee performs a roam, if the target is inside the investigation
                        area, it has a 2/3 (67%) chance of roaming to the target. This does not
                        occur during hunts.

                        This can result in a very high ability count on the post-game statistics.
                        The roam cannot be completed if the player is on a different floor.</Description>

                    <Description>The Banshee's hunt threshold is 50%, but it only checks the target's sanity
                        when trying to hunt, rather than the average sanity like other ghost types,
                        meaning that only the target needs to be at or below 50% sanity for it to
                        attempt to hunt.</Description>
                </Ability>
                <Ability>
                    <Name>Special hunting behavior</Name>
                    <Description>When a Banshee hunts, it will mostly follow standard hunt rules, but it will
                        ignore all players other than its hunt target. It will not attempt to chase
                        other players nor will it kill them, even if it comes into direct contact
                        with a non-target player, instead passing through them.

                        If the hunt target is outside the building, the Banshee will still use the
                        target's sanity to decide whether to hunt. However, if it does hunt, it will
                        hunt like any other ghost, chasing any opportune player.</Description>

                    <Description>When the Deogen is chasing a player, its speed is based on its pathfinding
                        distance to the target player and has three thresholds: above 6 meters,
                        between 6 and 2.5 meters and below 2.5 meters.
                        More than 6m: 3 m/s

                        If the Deogen is smudged or is otherwise not chasing any player, its speed will
                        remain at its current speed, or 1.6 m/s if its current speed is greater than
                        3 m/s. Otherwise, the Deogen does not alter its speed based on

                        through a Video Camera, and cannot be seen with the naked eye. A Goryo will
                        still manifest normally during ghost events and hunts with its ghost model,
                        which does not require any special equipment to be seen.</Description>

                    <Description>The Moroi has an ability to "curse" a target through the following ways:

                        By successfully obtaining a response from the Spirit Box; this will curse
                        the person who "caused" the response, either by asking questions or
                        triggering the failsafe.
                        By hearing whispers through the parabolic microphone.

                        When a player is cursed, their passive sanity drain is doubled, being in a
                        lit area will no longer prevent sanity drain. Walking
                        outside of the investigation area will still pause sanity drain until they
                        enter again. Consuming Sanity Medication removes the curse for that player.
                        Players that have been cursed before in the contract can be cursed again.
                        Multiple players can be cursed at the same time, but curses do not stack on
                        a single player.</Description>

                        two fingerprints lingering on the map with 40 seconds and 70 seconds before
                        timing out and disappearing are cut in half to 20 and 35 seconds remaining
                        respectively. This ability can be triggered multiple times in quick

                    <Description>During a hunt, the Obake has a 1/15 (6.67%) chance each time it flickers to
                        shapeshift into a different ghost model of the same gender. 
                        It will then return back to its original model. This is guaranteed
                        to happen at least once per hunt. Dead players cannot see this shapeshift.
                        The ghost changing into a different posture (e.g. going from standing to
                        crawling) within a hunt, while otherwise retaining the same model, is also
                        considered a shapeshift.</Description>

                    <Description>If a player is currently dead, the Onryo will blow out sources of flame (lit

                        increases this frequency. It will blow out flames at the same frequency as
                        other ghosts if no players are dead.</Description>

                        will blow out the flame instead, and the hunt will fail. This does not
                        restart the hunt cooldown timer, unlike a crucifix. If both a crucifix and a
                        flame are within range, the flame will take priority over the crucifix for
                        preventing the hunt.</Description>

                        blocked by normal prevention methods (e.g. a crucifix) or another flame.
                        
                        1. Note that there can be a delay of up to ~6 seconds before the hunt actually
                        initiates.
                        2. If a flame prevents a hunt or is blown out during a hunt, it will count
                        towards the three-flame rule.
                        3. Whether it was the same item being blown out does not matter; it can be the

                    <Description>Being within 10 metres of a Phantom while in pseudo line-of-sight (where
                        heartbeats play) reduces the player's sanity by 0.5%/s. This only applies
                        during ghost events and hunts, and is separate from passive sanity drain.
                        This does not apply during ghost events if the Phantom was made invisible by
                        taking a picture.</Description>

                    <Name>Occasionally roams to a random player</Name>
                    <Description>The Phantom has an ability where it will choose a random player and travel
                        to their location (as opposed to a regular roam). This will create an EMF
                        Level 2 reading at the targeted location. This behavior is somewhat similar
                        to that of the Banshee and the Wraith; unlike Banshees, Phantoms do not
                        select a player to target until they die or leave the game, and do not do
                        this as often; and unlike Wraiths, the Phantom physically walks to that
                        point rather than teleporting, and will set off Motion Sensors and disturb
                        Salt on the way to it.</Description>

                        the Poltergeist will always throw an item every 0.5 seconds, instead of only
                        having a 50% chance to do so.</Description>

                        multiple nearby items at once, creating an EMF level 2 reading (the thrown
                        items themselves generate EMF 3). This will decrease the sanity of all
                        nearby players in line-of-sight with the EMF 2 location by a percentage
                        equal to the number of items thrown multiplied by 2. The ability and
                        associated sanity drain works even when the lights are turned on.</Description>

                        modes. When a Revenant is roaming, it will move at 1 m/s. However, as soon
                        as it detects a player (either visually or through speech/electronics), it
                        will begin to move at 3 m/s (nearly twice the base speed of most other
                        ghosts) and sustains this speed until it reaches the spot where it last
                        detected a player. If and when reverting to roaming mode, the Revenant's
                        speed will slowly decrease over ~2.7 seconds (deceleration rate of 0.75
                        m/s²) back to its initial value of 1 m/s.</Description>

                    <Description>The Shade is less likely to perform ghost events at high sanity. At 100%
                        average sanity, it has a 0% chance of successfully performing an event. This
                        success rate increases by 2% per percentage of average sanity lost; at an
                        average sanity of 50%, an attempted ghost event will always succeed.</Description>

                        If it does manifest for a ghost event, it has a higher chance (67%) of
                        appearing as a shadow. If the ghost is made to appear using a Summoning
                        Circle, a Music Box, or a Monkey Paw, it has a chance of appearing as a
                        black shadow rather than in its full form while in the ghost event stage. It
                        will return to a fully visible form when the hunt begins.</Description>

                        regardless of average sanity. It may still perform these actions if it
                        happens to wander into a room without players. Since interactions
                        occur in a range, the Shade can still "reach" into the player's room from
                        another room to interact with objects.</Description>

                        ghosts, this will not prevent cursed hunts. This delay will still apply if
                        the Spirit was smudged while already hunting.

                        Every 1 to 2 minutes, the Thaye attempts to age; if at least one player is
                        in the same room as the ghost, the Thaye will add 1 to its age, else it will
                        wait another 30 seconds before attempting to age again.

                    <Description>The Mimic is able to imitate any type of ghost, and inherit all of its
                        features and abilities:

                        -Interaction and ghost event rates and preferences
                        -Hunt thresholds
                        -Hunt movement speeds
                        -Various forms of special abilities (e.g. Poltergeist multithrow, Demon
                        ability hunt)

                        The Mimic will change the ghost type that it chooses to imitate every 30
                        seconds to 2 minutes, but cannot change during hunts.
                        If The Mimic mimics a Thaye, a fixed age is randomly selected, and it will
                        mimic another ghost using its own timer instead of the Thaye's ageing
                        timer. The Mimic may also imitate the player or The Mimic (itself), but
                        in these cases, it will act as a "default" ghost and have no special
                        abilities. Mimicking the player, as well as any other ghost, does not change
                        its ghost model.</Description>

                        evidences themselves. For example, it is able to copy the Obake's
                        six-fingered handprints as The Mimic itself has Ultraviolet as evidence, but
                        it cannot copy the Goryo's trait of only appearing on a Video Camera when
                        interacting with a D.O.T.S Projector, as The Mimic does not have D.O.T.S.

                    <Description>When the Wraith is not hunting, it has a chance to teleport within 3 metres
                        of a random player, generating an EMF Level 2 reading at the location where
                        it teleported to, with a 25% chance for this to be an EMF Level 5 reading
                        instead. The Wraith will resume normal behaviour after teleporting.</Description>

                        temporarily increasing activity, it will return to its favourite room and be
                        trapped in it for 60 seconds. It can still leave that room by performing a
                        ghost event, but it will return to it once the event ends.</Description>

                <Ability>
                    <Name>May randomly shut a door and deduct nearby players' sanity</Name>
                    <Description>The Yurei has an ability that will cause the following when used:

                        - All players within 7.5 metres of the ghost will have their sanity
                        decreased
                        by 15%. Players outside the investigation area will not be affected by the
                        sanity drain.
                        - If the ghost's current room has one or more open door, it will randomly
                        select one and close it fully. This in turn produces an EMF 2
                        interaction, just like any other door touch.
                            1. The Yurei cannot use its ability if the room it is in has no door.
                            2. All ghosts can shut a door from in the same way the Yurei can, however
                            the Yurei may do it more often as it is connected to its sanity drain ability.
                        - Locker and closet doors are not affected by the Yurei's ability. Tent
                        doors, however, are.
                        If the ghost shuts a front door (exit door) fully without a ghost event or
                        hunt, then it is definitely a Yurei.</Description>
